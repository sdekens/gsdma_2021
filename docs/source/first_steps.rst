First Steps
===========

Hello World :)
--------------

First, collecting data of galeries, shafts and coal seams  as geopackages.


A few steps further
-------------------

GSDMA_2021 is used to model the geometry of a coal mine in order to modelise several things with modeflow. It used basic functions such as drawing shafts, galeries and coal seams on basis of real data. The limits of the geometries are defined at first. Then the geometries are grided so that it is possible to assign different properties to each grid. For this assignement, a model of the surfaces based is created on the known points. Then there is an assignement of an order and a orientation for those surfaces. The main functions are exposed in the part function.
