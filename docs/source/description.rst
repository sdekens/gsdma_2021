Description of the project 
===========================

The objective of this project is to create a 3D geometric model of a coal mine. The modeling takes place within the framework of the modeling and study of a geothermal system in former coal mines in Wallonia. Thus, the project aims to model the shafts, galleries and coal seams exploited. During the exploitation of coal, the rock collapsed behind the face, which leaves areas with high void rates, i.e. destressed zones.
This modeling will be done using georeferenced mine plans. These mine plans allow us to know the coordinates in two dimensions of the different parts studied. These coordinates are in the Lambert 72 reference system. In order to be able to model in three dimensions the elevations of the objects will have to be introduced. Thus, from raster images, the project can be vectorized in order to make geometric modeling possible.
